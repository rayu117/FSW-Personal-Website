<h2 class="meat-potatoes">About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a fullstack web developer passionate about exploring a new frontier through technology. Concepts such as AI or cloud computing, which were regarded as science fiction years ago, are already starting to mold our future. I canâ€™t wait to help build that future.
        I learned to code through the competitive Pursuit Fellowship for rising engineers and am proficient with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, Express, React/Redux, PostgreSQL, APIs, and Git, and have experience with sprints, Agile, code reviews, and pair programming. In addition to these technical skills and passion, I bring a calm and measured approach, communication and leadership to any project.</p>
